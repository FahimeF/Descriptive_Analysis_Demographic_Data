# Descriptive_Analysis_Demographic_Data
Descriptive analysis of the demographic data and determine changes in fertility rate and life expectancy.

Population statistics have always been an important topic for governments and researchers
in order to analyze them and make beneficial decisions for the future decisions
that may be helpful for not only human beings but also for the environment. This
can be achieved by data sources which are available with the help of censuses, surveys,
administrative records, and vital statistics. It therefore makes sense to
investigate past records and based on their trend, find population projections to obtain
a picture of demographic changes in the future.

In this project, demographic statistics of 5 regions and 21 subregions are used which
are available in the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau. The
purpose is to analyze the given data set and determine changes in fertility rate and life
expectancy.

An insight into the demographic data is provided by statistical methods and graphical
representations such as Mean, Median, Quartiles, Correlation coefficient, Histogram,
Scatter plot, and Box plot. More precisely, the frequency distribution of the given data
set is provided by Histograms, and defining the mean and median of observations helps to
get a better understanding of data dispersion. Box plots also give a summary of the data
distribution with help of quartiles. In addition, Scatter plots indicate the relationship
between variables and are used to illustrate changes between years.
